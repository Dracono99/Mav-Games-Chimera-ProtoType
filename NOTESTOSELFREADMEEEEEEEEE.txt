notes to self
add raw input to input core
extrapolate gui so that buttons are added in game state 
research reading and writing to and from a texture file in shader code so that we can store mesh damage info
get multiplayer fully flushed out n working
get a campaign state set up use decal for board pos lots of game play code will likely be needed
side note extrapolate gui so that we can use other sprite sheets so we get high tech lookin buttons n sliders
build a test mesh for damage shader 
build decaling demo in options just shoot bullet hole decals into a big static blocky thing
obtain high tech ish looking tank for networking mp meshes
prolly should add an intro movie state time permitting need to make movie first with shayli's music
want to have damage shader working at least some what by this weekend so we can show some thing in the blog
also blog post on theory of damage shader after research
also update decal shader with new demo and info gained remember homogenous space and hogogenous clip space
